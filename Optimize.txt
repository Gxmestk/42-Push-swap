From the visualizer
This algorithm is slow when pushing back from stack_b to stack_a at group 1 and 2 which contain 66% of value

and a reverse rotate instruction the bottom to top have to be use 

This code can be optimize further by

2) Smarter partition by log base 3 partition + partition arrange like quicksort by pre calculating all of the pivot. 
for example,
- weigthing to the max node (if max node and move < 10 at group 1 and 2
then return and use those movement)
